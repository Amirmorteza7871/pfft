PFFT - Parallel FFT based on FFTW

Overview
--------
PFFT is a software library written in C for computing parallel fast Fourier  
transformations. 

For an introduction, please read the paper 
  ''PFFT - An Extension of FFTW to Massively Parallel Architectures''
available at http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/mpip/publikationen.php.en
This is the most current general paper, and the one that we recommend if you wish 
to cite PFFT.

The install of PFFT follows the typical steps
  ./bootstrap.sh
  ./configure
  make
  make install
Optionally, a bunch of test programs can be built with
  make check

The bootstrap step can be skipped if you delivered a PFFT tarball,
i.e., the file configure was already generated.
Make sure that configure can find a working install of FFTW-3.3 with MPI support,
i.e., set 
  CPPFLAGS=$PATHTOFFTW/include
and
  LDFLAGS=$PATHTOFFTW/lib64 or LDFLAGS=$PATHTOFFTW/lib
depending on your system architecture.

PFFT tarballs include a detailed user guide at 
  doc/manual.pdf
If you have cloned the PFFT repository, the user manual is automatically built during 'make'.
Of course this requires a working LaTeX enviroment.
Alternatively, you can download a recent version of the user manual at
  http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~mpip/software.php.en

Note that using PFFT is very similar to FFTW. The interface is as close to the fftw_mpi
interface as possible. Therefore, it is a good start to read FFTW manual:
  http://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc
At least you should understand how FFTW deals with distributed memory FFTs:
  http://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/Distributed_002dmemory-FFTW-with-MPI.html#Distributed_002dmemory-FFTW-with-MPI
Next, you can have a look at the test programs in directory 'tests' to learn the details of the PFFT interface.

For installation instructions, you can also refer to the file INSTALL
in this directory.

Your comments are welcome! This is the first version of the library and may
not be as robust or well documented as it should be. Please keep track of bugs
