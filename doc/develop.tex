\section{Search and replace patterns}

Correct alignment of pfft.h header
\begin{lstlisting}
%s/^\(    [^ ]\+[^\\]*\)  \\/  \1\\/g  
\end{lstlisting}

Expand most macros of pfft.h to generate the function reference of this manual:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,prebreak=\textbackslash,]
sed -e 's/ *\\$//g' -e 's/PFFT_EXTERN //g' \
    -e 's/PX(\([^)]*\))/pfft_\1/g' -e 's/ INT/ ptrdiff_t/g' \
    -e 's/ R/ double/g' -e 's/ C/ pfft_complex/g' \
    -e 's/^  //g' pfft.h > pfft.h.expanded
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \code{PFFT_FORWARD} is defined as \code{FFTW_FORWARD}
  \item \code{FFTW_FORWARD} is defined as $-1$
  \item PFFT allows to chose between \code{FFTW_FORWARD} and \code{FFTW_BACKWARD}, which is not implemented by FFTW.
  \item Matlab uses the same sign convention, i.e., $-1$ for \code{fft} and $+1$ for \code{ifftn}
\end{itemize}

\section{Pruned FFT and Shifted Index Sets}
\subsection{Pruned FFT}
For pruned r2r- and c2c-FFT are defined as
\begin{equation*}
  g_l = \sum_{k=0}^{n_i-1} \hat g_k \eim{kl/n}, \quad l=0,\hdots,n_o-1,
\end{equation*}
where $n_i\le n$ and $n_o\le n$.

\subsection{Shifted Index Sets}
For $N\in 2\N$ we define the FFT with shifted inputs


For $K,L,N\in 2\N$, $L<N$, $L<N$ we define


\code{PFFT_SHIFTED_IN}
